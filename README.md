# ravetrip-calculator

Based on the Code Academy trip cost project, I was able to come up with a different version for something aligns with my hobbies. I have a big music festival/rave coming up in March so I want to be able to create a total cost calculator that includes: merch, travel and ticket cost.

I would revist this project when I advance my skills in python to create more complex functions.
